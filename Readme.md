Acebug Firebug Extension
========================

Acebug is a Firebug Extension that brings the power of the Ace Editor to Firebug. Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript and is embedded into Firebug to bring syntax highlighting to the JavaScript Console.

In the future we plan to add various options including:

* Integration with script panel (including breakpoints, debugging etc.) and other Firebug panels
* Obviously the resource panel is in it's early stages, lots of work to do there!
* More translations .. volunteers are always welcome
