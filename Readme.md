Acebug Firebug Extension
========================

Acebug is a Firebug Extension that brings the power of the Ace Editor to Firebug. Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript and is embedded into Firebug to bring syntax highlighting to the JavaScript Console. In the future we plan to add various options including:

* Integration with script panel (including breakpoints, debugging etc.)
* Autocompletion
* Improved context menu items
* Internationalization
* <ctrl><enter> shortcut
* Options - Choose keyboard bindings (vim, emacs etc.), choose color scheme, etc., etc.
